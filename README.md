## Guide
It is a simple game for single person and can add bot to player with you to **BOBING**. The function is not perfect but the operation is easy and intersting.

First press the Single Player, choosing the bot number, then shake or hold the button to roll dices, to **BOBING** enjoy playing!!


The function can be extended by adding the network and internet Battle, also can add VoIP to altogether in Mid-Autumn Festival in Cloud.

## Version
- **ver0.1**: Achieve first UI, add backgroud music "《一剪梅》 --费玉清"， slider bar and toggle to control the volume and start and stop

## Result and feeling
Even through the final version is not perfect but we paid a lot of time. espacially on **3D model building** for dice and bowl.


> _"when the first time we determined using **Unity**, I was shock, but after that I paid 1day to learn it breifly"_
